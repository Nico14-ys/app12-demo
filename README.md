<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About the Project
This project was initiated as a personal exploration into software engineering, providing a platform to strengthen my technical skills in areas like database connections and object-oriented programming. While university group projects enhance collaboration, they leave limited space for focused technical growth. Inspired by a discussion with my high school Chinese teacher, I decided to develop a revision app tailored to assist students in preparing for the HKDSE, particularly offering a systematic approach to revision for Paper 1 Part A.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Software Details

There are lots of features I want to include, but I’m prioritising the essentials first so students can start using the app. My goal is to regularly release a working prototype to gather feedback. Once the basics are in place, I’ll move on to adding features that improve the experience and help with revision.
